                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

                        <p>
                            Elements can be either <em><strong>inline</strong></em> (effecting just the text enclosed by tags), or <em><strong>block</strong></em> (block elements have an invisible box around them with height and width that separates them from any other element). While most Elements have both an <em><strong>opening</strong></em> and <em><strong>closing</strong></em> tag, some Elements use only one tag and are referred to as <em><strong>void.</strong></em>
                        </p>

                        A Couple Other Points to Remember:

                        <div class= "TextFormat Text1">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why? Because they interpret instruction literally. If you use the wrong Element name in your opening tag or make a typo, a computer cannot "know" what you intended. A program will only work if the instructions are clear and the grammar correct.
                            </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't try to memorize every single fact. Instead, concentrate on understanding how programming languages work, and rely on the internet to remind you of an Element's name or a particular structure.

                        Once you know the language, you can look at any HTML code and understand a great deal about how it will look as a web page. Likewise, you can view any web page and know what the underlying code looks like.

                        <p>
                            To make the calculation easier, we put the following code into our CSS file:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="IndentedText">
                            <li>* { </li>
                            <li>box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                            <li> } </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Now, the calculation of the box includes both the border and the padding, so that it's easier to make layouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You just set the width of the overall box, and no matter how you tweak the padding and border layers, the size of the box will always stay the same.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The CSS must include browser-specific prefixes:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="IndentedText">
                            <li>-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                            <li>-moz-box-sizing: border-box; </li>
                            <li>-ms-box-sizing: border-box </li>
                            <li>box-sizing: border-box</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can set the size of your box layers in pixels or in percentages:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="IndentedText">
                            <li>
                                % changes the box as the screen size changes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pixel sets the image to one size, regardless of device. This can lead to a bad user experience
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can set max-width, so that an element can get smaller, but not larger than a set value. Max-width won't change layout.

            <h2 class="Title2">
                What is a variable?
            </h2>
                <p class="TextFormat Text2">
                    In computer programming the word <em>variable</em> denotes a storage location containing some <em><strong>value</strong></em> that is paired with an <em><strong>identifier</strong></em> (a symbolic name).  When a value has been paired with an identifier, we say that it has been <em><strong>assigned</strong></em>.
                </p>
        
      
            <h2 class="Title2">
                How is a value assigned?
            </h2>
            <div class="TextFormat Text2">
                <p>
                    In Python, the syntax for assigning a value to an identifier is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul class="NoBullets">
                    <li>
                        name = expression (where <em>name</em> is the <strong>identifier</strong> and <em>expression</em> is the <strong>value</strong>.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The operator "=" is used in Python only to assign a value to an identifier.   The "=" is not interpreted as "is equal to" as in standard math equations such as "1 + 1 = 2."  Instead, Python uses the "==" in expressions that are meant to be read as "is equal to."  
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:  
                </p>
                <ul class="NoBullets">
                    <li>
                        myName = "smebird" (assigning a value)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        myName == "smebird" (declaring myName to be equal to the value "smebird") 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
      
            <h2 class="Title2">
                Why use variables?
            </h2>
            <div class="TextFormat Text2">
                <p>
                    <strong>Variables are flexible.</strong>
                </p>
                <ol class="IndentedText Text2">
                    <li>
                        Variables can be either text characters ("strings,") or numbers. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changing the value or <strong>expression</strong> of a variable in one place changes it everywhere in your document.
                    </li>
                    <li>  
                        The value or expression of a variable can be as small as one character, or as long as the text of an entire book.
                    </li> 
                    <li> 
                        Number values can be acted upon using mathematical operators, such as "+" (addition), "-" (subtraction), "*" (multiplication), and "/" (division).
                    </li> 
                    <li> 
                        String values can be combined using the "+" symbol.  This is referred to as "Concatenation," and while it uses the same symbol as addition, the effect on numbers and strings is very different.  
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul class="NoBullets Text2">
                    <li>
                        For Example:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>myString = "2" + "2" </strong> (produces the value <strong>"22,"</strong> a new string)

                    <li>
                        <strong>myNumber = 2 + 2 </strong> (produces the value <strong>4,</strong> an integer)

            <div class="TextFormat Text2">
                <p>
                    In Python, any value/expression that is enclosed in quotation marks, whether single or double, will be interpreted as a string, as in the following examples:

                <ul class="NoBullets Text2">
                    <li>

                        someNumbers = '0123456789'

                    <li>
                        text_plusNumbers = '0123456789 and "smebird"'
                    </li>

                <p>
                    To use Python to do any calculations, numbers are entered as a value with no quotation marks, as in the following examples:
                </p>
                <ul class="NoBullets Text2">
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        myMultiplication = 1234 * 4321
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        myExponents = 3**9

                    The convention for identifiers is to start with a lowercase character. You cannot begin an identifier with a number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python will print strings in a different color, making it is easy to catch errors, like a forgotton end quote.

                <p>
                    Changing the assigned value does not actually delete the former value from storage. It continues to exist, but is no longer paired to its original identifier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If unpaired values are left in storage, programs can suffer "memory leaks" as storage reaches capacity, eventually leading to a program crash. There are <strong>Garbage Collection Modules</strong> available for Python that can be used to clear cluttered storage.

                <p >
                    Another powerful way to alter a string value is using its <em>index number </em>to select a character or a series of characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each character in a string has an assigned place value, starting with zero.

                <li>
                    <strong>myExample[some number:identical number]</strong> (designates an empty string)

                        Procedure composition allows for powerful and flexible programming.  One function can be used as a component of many other functions, reducing the amount of code that has to be written, and increasing the variety of outputs possible.

                        While loops use the comparison operators: "==", "!=", "<", ">", to test whether a test expression is True.  If the result is "True", the code contained within the while loop will be executed.  Once the test expression gives a value of "False", the code will be skipped and the function will drop to the next line.

                        Syntax errors are the easiest to make and the easiest to fix.  They occur when the programmer has violated the "grammar" rules of Python.  An example of a syntax error is:

                    <p>
                        Logic erros occur the a program has good syntax, but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another. The program may not crash, but the output is unintended. A good example of a logic error might be "take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle."

                        Semantic errors can be the hardest to find. In this case, the syntax is good, the logic of the operations is correct, but the meaning of one or more lines of code is not what the programmer intended.  In English, the equivalent would be like the following (copied from: <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2011-January/081490.html" class="reference">Python Tutor</a>).

                    <p>
                        In programming, this would be the equivalent of using an "alist[1:2]" instead of an "alist[1:3]" in an expression. The Python interpreter will have no problem executing the command, but the values returned may be incorrect.

                        A list can be empty or contain hundreds of elements (expressions). A list can contain strings, numbers or other lists.

                    <p>
                        Each element of a list must be seaparated by a comma.

                        <strong>What makes a list more powerful than strings?:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no limitations on what a list can contain.  A single list can be made up of a combination of strings, integers, floats or more lists. Each element of a list has its own index number (starting at zero) and can be printed, replaced, added to or deleted.  Lists contained in lists are called <strong>nested lists</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following is an example of a nested list:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="NoBullets">
                        <li>
                            beatles = [['John', 1940], ['Paul', 1942], ['George', 1943], ['Ringo', 1940]]
                        </li>
                    </ul>    
                    <p>
                        This list gives us four elements, each of which is a list containing two pieces of information. In order to access a specific element, we call its index number.
                    </p> 
                    <ul class="NoBullets">
                        <li>
                           print  beatles[3]  --- (gives us ['Ringo', 1940])
                        </li>
                    </ul>   
                    <p>
                        If we want to access a specific element in that nested list, we use to separate brackets.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="NoBullets">
                        <li>
                           print  beatles[3][0]  --- (gives us 'Ringo')
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        <strong>How do we use lists?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two powerful concepts of lists are <strong>mutation</strong> and <strong>aliasing</strong>.

                    <p>
                        Mutation allows us to change the value of an element. With strings, each time we assigned a new value to an existing string, we left the previous value in memory.  The original value was not overridden, but was no longer paired to our variable and could not be accessed unless re-assigned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With mutation, if we change an element, we replace the original value.  This means that any variable referring to that list will be changed as well.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="NoBullets">
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            print q --- (gives us 'Yello')
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p >
                        When two variables, as in the above example, refer to the same objects, we call this aliasing.  Aliasing can be useful when you want to enact changes across multiple variables, even when that change occurs as part of a function. This can lead to confusion if you forget that you have aliases and see a variable change in your program, and do not know why that change happened. 
                    </p>
                    <p >
                        However, any alias can be broken by simply assigning one of the aliased variables a new value:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="NoBullets">
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            q = p
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            p = [1, 2, 3]
                        </li>
                         <li>
                            print p --- (gives us [1, 2, 3])
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            print q --- (gives us 'Hello')
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p >
                        In the above example, we changed p's assigned value, just as we would do if p had been a string.  A re-assignment is not the same as a mutation.  Now, p and q are assigned different values and a mutation to one will not effect the other.

                        Append is a mutation, so it affects all aliases.  It <strong>very important</strong> to understand that if append is used to add a list containing several elements to another list, the added will be read as <strong>one</strong> element, regardless of what it contains:

                    Once we are ready to write the actual Python code for the "Take a Break" program, it is a good idea to search the web for any code that already solves some of what we plan to do.  <em>"Stackoverflow"</em> is an excellent site.

                    The code that we used above: "webbrowser.open()" and "time.sleep()," are functions saved in Python's library, which we downloaded when we installed the program. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not see the lines of code that make up these functions. Using functions in this way is called <strong>Abstraction</strong>.

                <p>
                    Instead of reading the code to understand how a Python library function works, we use Python's <strong>Documentation</strong>.
